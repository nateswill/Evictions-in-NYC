# Mapping_NYC_Evictions_Data

In this project I explore making maps with the [Python Plotly Express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/) library using jupyter notebooks.  The dataset is [NYC evictions data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Evictions/6z8x-wfk4) that is publicly available on the NYC Open Data website.  The Plotly Express library is easy to use and has lots of high level interactive features, including automatic hover labels. You can also zoom in and out and click and drag the map to move it. I also included a geocoding notebook where I geocoded the evictions addresses using the Nominatum library and OpenStreetMap. Check out the notebooks for details!  As Plotly Express does not work with Github please download the notebooks to get the full interactive experience.
